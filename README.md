## Quick start guide

<mark>In case you already have node.js and npm, make sure you update them before attempting to build the images</mark>

If you want to execute the project you will need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Make sure the three of them are installed in your system. Download the project with `git clone https://github.com/arquisoft/lomap_es5c`. The fastest way to launch everything is with docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will create two docker images as they don't exist in your system (the webapp and the restapi) and launch a mongo container database. It will also launch Prometheus and Grafana containers to monitor the webservice. You should be able to access everything from here:

- [Webapp - http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- [RestApi example call - http://localhost:5001/api/users/list](http://localhost:5001/api/users/list)
- [RestApi raw metrics - http://localhost:5001/metrics](http://localhost:5001/metrics)
- [Prometheus server - http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- [Grafana server http://localhost:9091](http://localhost:9091)

If you want to run it without docker. Compile and run the restapi:

```shell
cd restapi
npm install
npm start
```

Now the webapp:

```shell
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```

You should be able to access the application in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
