== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

|=======================
|*Decision*|*Details*|*Advantages*|*Disadvantages*
|Architecture | We will use MVC as the architecture design. | We will have a very well structured code separarated by Model, View and Controller.| The separation in layers makes the application more complex.
|Data Base| We will use MongoDB to store some information.| MonboDB works good with NodeJS. | It is a new technology for the team, so we have to learn.
|OpenStreetMaps API| We will use the API to create the map. | It's free, not like the Google Maps API.| It's the first time using it, we'll have to adapt.
|Docker+AWS| We use them to deploy the application.| It's free and it provides a very fast deployment. | The general cloud computing issues as backup protection.
|CSS+Bootstrap| We use it to add a nice look to the application.| It's a well known stylesheet languaje for the team. | Different browsers work different, we have to take care of it.|
